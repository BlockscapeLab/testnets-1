# e-Money Test Networks

We are launching a series of testnets to conduct testing before mainnet launch. We invite everybody to join!

Help and assistance is available in our [validator hangout group](https://t.me/joinchat/HBB5elfpWv8rADBFhhjbtg).

## Latest Test Network

Chain ID: lilmermaid-5  
Genesis:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-money/testnets/master/lilmermaid-5/genesis.json  
Software: [v0.5.7](https://github.com/e-money/em-ledger/releases/tag/v0.5.7)  
Explorer: https://e-money.network *  

\* The block explorer does not accurately display multiple denominations yet.

## Seed Nodes

```

```

## Faucet

There is a faucet account available that is entirely self-service, with a few conditions:

1) Only take what you need
2) Return what you don't need
3) We'll top up as needed

Use `emcli keys add --recover faucet` to add the faucet account:
```
Mnemonic: involve survey split brass forum enemy lend kid crowd gaze boil social boring image slide force sausage enough near excess paddle kingdom slender all
Address:  emoney127teu2esvmqhhcn5hnh29eq7ndh7f3etnsww7v
```

We suggest validators transfer "1000000000000ungm,50000000000eeur,50000000000echf,50000000000eusd" from the account.

## Rewards

Validators who participated in the testnets will be rewarded for their support as follows:

2000 NGM* for each testnet they participated in (lilmermaid-3 and later)  
5000 NGM* bonus for joining mainnet within 24 hours  

As the mainnet launch will be centralized, rewards can be paid out to validators on request and rewards can used to self-bond.

\* Please note the NGM token is currently not tradeable, but will be sold during the [token presale](https://e-money.com/presale.html) for EUR 0.50.
